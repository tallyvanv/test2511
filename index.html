        <h2>A funny story</h2>
        <p>My friend's second band broke up. This happened right after their last show. Right after, I joined her on
            tour with her first band. During the first gig, a fan (an older gentleman), came up to us and asked me if I
            could take a picture of the two of them. As I was taking the picture, I noticed the image on his T-shirt.
            The people on it looked like the members of the other band. When we asked the man about it, he said it was
            based on a picture of the band's final gig. Obviously, they had never made merch of this because they broke
            up right after. Yes, it was a bootleg T-shirt of the worst gig ever.</p>
        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>Right after my friend's band broke up, she met a man who made a bootleg T-shirt of their final show.</p>
